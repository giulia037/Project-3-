# Furry Friends Adoptions 

## Description
This collaboration between Destiny Ratsavong and Giulia Shelton is a concept that allows for a user to find lost, abandoned and stray companion animals to adopt. On the hompage displays a list of adoptable animals. 

Users can select one animal by clicking on it to view more information about that particular animal. User can utilize the contact form to submit an inquiry about adopting an animal or inquire about the charity.  

## Installation and Usage
To install, start by installing the frontend and backend dependencies. While inside this directory, run 
`npm Install` to install the node modules within the server and client folder. After that is complete, run the command `npm start`. To seed the database run `npm run seed`. Run `npm run develop` to start the development server. The app should then run on localhost:3000. To create a production build, run `npm run build`.
